# Personal Portfolio (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Vite + React

The goal of this project is to create a professional, scalable, and visually appealing single-page portfolio to showcase my work, projects, and experience.

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This project is currently under active development.  
The structure is in place, but features, sections, and styling are being added step by step.
